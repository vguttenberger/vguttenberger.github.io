						<p>
							 Podium is an application I am helping a friend design and build -- so far it is in the very early stages of design. The idea of the app is to be a mobile platform for virtual town halls, connecting people to figures that they care about and want to hear from in an interactive way.

						<h4 class="mb-20"> Wireframes </h4>
						<p> The initial wireframes (done in Sketch) looked like this: </p>

				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> Initial Design </h4>
						<p> 
							Thinking about the way users interact with applications, some preliminary design decisions I made were: to maintain the card component (as it is an intuitive and popular way to organize and sift through data) but make it a swiping system instead of scrolling, create a global theme in terms of typography and colors (my plan is to make the application black and white to maintain the sanctity and seriousness of a news app, with some splashes of color in images to put a more fun and social media-esque spin on it), have a consistent top bar across pages (to tie the application together), and use words on the bottom instead of icons (for easier understanding and formatting). </br> </br>

							I decided to first focus on two of the components: the main screen listing interviewees, and the card component where users sift through questions. This initial prototype was done using AdobeXD: 

						</p>
						<img class="pl-200 pt-20 pb-20" src="img/podium_design1.png">
						<p>
							I cleaned these up a bit and incorporated photos, to bring it closer to what it would look like in reality. Also, after receiving some feedback, made some changes to the card design: getting rid of the ‘x’ and '<3' (as they are superfluous), and making the card longer and setting the image to take up more space, in order to make it more immersive:
						</p>
						<img class="pl-200 pt-20 pb-20" src="img/podium_design2.png">
						<p>
							The next feature I worked on was the Question Record section, focusing on how to make recording totally immersive, easy to search and send a user’s recording, and providing feedback that is was successful: 
						</p>
						<img class="pl-90 pt-20 pb-20" src="img/podium_design3.png">
						<p>
							Here it is all together in an interactive prototype:
						</p>	
						<video class="podium-video" controls>
						  <source src="img/podium_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						</video>
					</div>
				</div>	
				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> Next Steps </h4>
						<p> 
							This is a very initial-stages design. Some feedback I received to consider for my next design iteration is: to flip the order of the screens (to Explore, Record, Browse instead of the current Browse, Explore, Record), make each card stack have a main title of the interview category and each individual card to have the individual question title, and think about a different and more detailed way to present feedback. </br></br>

							Some other things I think are good to keep in mind as the application scales up is: incorporate a calendar feature for scheduled interviews, develop a newsfeed for personalization, organize the Browse screen better when there will be a high volume of people (organize by category?), implement the pages for when an interviewee is clicked from the Browse screen. </br></br>

							Our plan for next steps is to bring this idea and design to a Hackathon and implement the initial proof of concept! From there, we will come across more design insights, new ideas, and can start usability testing.
