						<h4 class="mb-20"> Idea </h4>
						<p>
							 Molotro is an application I helped design with a group (members: Rachel Perry, Justin Sukernik, Bill Yung) for my Human-Computer Interaction class. This web application is a platform used for the purpose of travelers to find recommendations made by locals. Travelers search in a specific area based on their interests and preferences, and are matched with locals who make relevant recommendations, and that travelers can even connect with.

				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> First Steps and Analysis </h4>
						<p> 
							We started the design process by writing up User Characteristics, Usability Goals, Usage Scenarios, and a Conceptual Model (including objects, object attributes, object relationships, actions of objects, actions on attributes, and actions on relationships). </br></br>

							Next, we performed a Semantic Level analysis on various actions (which included the function, parameters, description, feedback, errors, and task-command analysis). We also performed a Lexical Design, specifically for viewing a profile, and created a Syntactic Level graph, specifically for viewing a profile:

				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> Paper Prototype </h4>
						<p> 
							Our next step was making a paper prototype and introducing it to users for testing:

				</div>	
				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> Medium Fidelity Prototype </h4>
						<p> 
							After the paper prototype and testing, we moved on to make a medium-fidelity prototype using UXPin. Some initial designs:

						<p>
							And here is a demo of a more developed prototype:

					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> User Testing and Further Evaluation </h4>
						<p> 		
							After creating this prototype, we performed more extensive user testing and gained design feedback. We created a task list for participants to perform, and had them fill out a survey after testing. From the survey we gained participant metrics, pros to the application design, and areas to improve. </br></br>

							Next, we performed a Heuristic Evaluation, as well as a Competitive Analysis comparing our site to similar existing products. We made some changes based on our user feedback, and performed another usability test with different participants.
						</p>

				</div>
				<div class="row pb-30">
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h4 class="mb-20"> Final Design </h4>
						<p> For our final design we made some changes gathered from user feedback: allowing the ability to click on a profile to read it (not just the "Read Reviews" button), replacing the "Job" section on a local's profile to "Interests" (as that is more relevant), improving the "Edit Profile Page", including a newly designed logo, and adding more pictures and colors. We also thought about how we could make this aplication on a mobile platform and made some preliminary designs. Here is a demo of our final project: </p>
						<iframe class ="pl-90 pt-20 pb-20" width="1000" height="500"
						src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5z3V7UZoN9w">
						</iframe>
						<p>
							After this final design, we created a potential roadmap of where we would see this product going: how we would continue to work on this, additional potential features that could be added in the future, and how the product would fit in to the market.
